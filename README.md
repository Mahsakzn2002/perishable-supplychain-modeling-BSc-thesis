## Overview

This presentation summarizes a mathematical modeling project that compares centralized, decentralized, and coordinated (buy-back contract) supply chain structures in the context of perishable products.  
Key focus areas include:

- Effects of perishability and deterioration
- Bullwhip effect in decentralized systems
- Coordination via buy-back contract
- Profitability and waste minimization strategies

## Ongoing Development

This project is currently under further development. Planned enhancements include:

Transitioning from a deterministic to a stochastic modeling framework (e.g., uncertain demand).

Replacing the fixed deterioration rate with a nonlinear or time-dependent function to better reflect real-world perishability.

General improvements in model structure, numerical experimentation, and result visualization.

Quantifying the bullwhip effect to evaluate the impact of coordination on demand variability.

Stay tuned for upcoming updates.

Stay tuned.
